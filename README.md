# Entertainment-Hub
This repository contains the source code for Entertainment-Hub which contains three classic games implemented using the Tkinter library in Python - 2048, Snakes, and Tic Tac Toe. These games are developed as part of a project to demonstrate the use of Tkinter for GUI-based game development in Python.

Games Included
1. 2048: The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid and combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. The game ends when the grid is full and no more moves can be made.

2. Snakes: The classic snake game where the player controls a snake and tries to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

3. Tic Tac Toe: The classic game of Tic Tac Toe where two players take turns placing their symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when a player manages to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (usually included with Python installations)

Game Controls
1> 2048: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to slide the tiles on the grid.
2> Snakes: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
3> Tic Tac Toe: Click on an empty cell on the grid to place your symbol.

Acknowledgements
The game logic and mechanics for each game are inspired by their respective classic versions.
The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using the Tkinter library in Python.
The project is developed as part of a learning exercise in game development and GUI programming.
